    <h2 id="About">About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Full Stack Developer with experience in iOS and Culinary. Studying cooking gave me considerable experience with organization and time management, these skills translate very well to writing code. I turned to coding when I made a simple Frogger-like game through a tutorial, and found a passion for logic I never knew I had. I have experience working with a team and understand the importance of writing clean, readable code. I am passionate about the Rangers, working out and learning new technologies.
